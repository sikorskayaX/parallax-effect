        <h2>Parallax scrolling effects</h2>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics where background images move past the camera more 
            slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance.
             The technique grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation since the 1930s.
             Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics where background images move past the camera more slowly than 
             foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance. The technique grew out of the multiplane 
             camera technique used in traditional animation since the 1930s.
             Parallax scrolling was popularized in 2D computer graphics with its introduction to video games in the early 1980s. 
             Some parallax scrolling was used in the arcade video game Jump Bug (1981). It used a limited form of parallax scrolling w
             ith the main scene scrolling while the starry night sky is fixed and clouds move slowly, adding depth to the scenery. 
             The following year, Moon Patrol (1982) implemented a full form of parallax scrolling, with three separate background 
             layers scrolling at different speeds, simulating the distance between them. Moon Patrol is often credited with popularizing 
             parallax scrolling. Jungle King (1982), later called Jungle Hunt, also had parallax scrolling,
              and was released a month after Moon Patrol in June 1982.
        <h3>Layer method</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Some display systems support multiple background layers that can be scrolled independently in horizontal and 
            vertical directions and composited on one another, simulating a multiplane camera. On such a display system, 
            a game can produce parallax by simply changing each layer's position by a different amount in the same direction. 
            Layers that move more quickly are perceived to be closer to the virtual camera. Layers can be placed in front of
             the playfield—the layer containing the objects with which the player interacts—for various 
            reasons such as to provide increased dimension, obscure some of the action of the game, or distract the player.
        </p>
        <h3>Sprite method</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Programmers may also make pseudo-layers of sprites—individually controllable moving objects drawn 
            by hardware on top of or behind the layers—if they are available on the display system. For instance Star Force, an
             overhead-view vertically scrolling shooter for NES, 
            used this for its starfield, and Final Fight for the Super NES used this technique for the
             layer immediately in front of the main playfield.The Amiga computer has sprites which can have any
              height and can be set horizontal with the copper co-processor, which makes them ideal for this purpose.
              Risky Woods on the Amiga uses sprites multiplexed with the copper to create an 
              entire fullscreen parallax background layer as an alternative to the system's dual playfield mode.

        <h3>Repeating pattern/animation method</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Scrolling displays built up of individual tiles can be made to 'float' over a repeating
             background layer by animating the individual tiles' bitmaps in order to portray the parallax effect. 
             Color cycling can be used to animate tiles quickly on the whole screen. This software effect 
             gives the illusion of another (hardware) layer. Many games used this technique for a scrolling star-field, but sometimes 
            a more intricate or multi-directional effect is achieved, such as in the game Parallax by Sensible Software.
        </p>
        <h3>Raster method</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In raster graphics, the lines of pixels in an image are typically composited and refreshed in
         top-to-bottom order with a slight delay (called the horizontal blanking interval) between drawing one 
         line and drawing the next line. Games designed for older graphical chipsets—such as those of the third 
         and fourth generations of video game consoles, those of dedicated TV games, 
        or those of similar handheld systems—take advantage of the raster characteristics to create the illusion of more layers.
        Some display systems have only one layer. These include most of the classic 8-bit systems
        (such as the Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, Master System, PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 and original Game Boy). 
        The more sophisticated games on such systems generally divide the layer into horizontal strips, 
        each with a different position and rate of scrolling. 
        Typically, strips higher on the screen will represent things farther away from the virtual camera or
         one strip will be held stationary to display status information. The program will then wait for horizontal 
         blank and change the layer's scroll position just before the display system begins to draw each scanline.
         This is called a "raster effect" and is also useful for changing the system palette to provide a gradient background.
